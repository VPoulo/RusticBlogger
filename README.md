# RusticBlogger

<p>
Specific Project Vision
MVP
•	Basic frontend which will have two pages. One page will be a form for the post creating and the other page will contain all blog posts made.
•	Ability to delete a post.
	
	Goals
•	Call google oAuth API so users can login to their account.
•	Tags can be added to the post to indicate subtopics
•	Users can save posts as a draft and then see the drafts later.
•	Users can edit/update blog posts.
•	Link blog post to other posts and have the linked posts displayed as links. 
•	Responsive website 

I would like to publish the website and have people be able to go to it and use it. If I can get through enough of the goal features, I might keep it and improve upon it in future terms.


Issues of concern
I am a bit nervous about creating a frontend for the blog. I will start by making something static and easy, and then add functionality later as time allows.  I am not sure how hard this project will be, so I have listed the basic functions I want to get started with first and then I will work my way through the goal features.
