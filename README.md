### Final Project: Rustic Blogger

### Rust Programming

### Fall Term 2023

#### Run Instructions

1. Make sure you are in the **blog_restapi** sub-folder.

2. Use **cargo run** command to start the app service.

3. **click on the link** at the bottom of the terminal to launch the website locally.

** I have already provided a json file with starter blog posts.

#### Write-up

<p> My project is to create a blog website. I wrote a RestAPI as a Rust library and then used that library to add, delete, and read posts from a json file. All the posts from the blog are saved locally to a json file. I have populated the json and included it in my submission so you can see the website and how it works. I wrote the main file in Rust as well. It does the mapping to different pages and handles the routing. </p>

**There is a warning when compiling the code. It is a warning of a depenency of a crate I'm using. I talked to Bart about it and he said its okay.**
